* DONE Load Data
CLOSED: [2020-11-04 Wed 14:55]
 Load the data using pandas
 ~load_data~
    Loads in rocstories csv file and iterates over the stories
    - Returns a generator of stories
    - a generator is like a collection/list that isn't populated until a item is requested
    - calling a ~next~ function on the generator gives an item if there is one left
    - if there are no items left, returns that it is empty

 #+BEGIN_src python
for story in load_data("~/path/to/rocstories.csv"):
    print(story)
#+end_src

* DONE Parse Data using Spacy
CLOSED: [2020-11-04 Wed 14:55]
- Want to load up spacy (or keep it loaded)
- Want to pass each sentence into spacy
  + store the parse as well.
* TODO Extract Dependency Pairs
* TODO Count Dependency pairs
* TODO Protagonist detection
- Heuristic 1: first mentioned protagonist
- Heuristic 2: Most frequently mentioned protagonist
- Heuristic 3: break ties in 2 with 1
* TODO How to use Coreference
- output looks like ~[(entity1, 2), (entity2, 1) ... ]~
- Want to store and count ~[(story-id, entity, VERB, relation, index)]~
- Want to find all instance where /lose/ and /find/ refer to the same entity?
  + start of by counting all stories that have /lose/ and /find/
    - find all story-ids where at least one verb is /lose/
      + find all story-ids where at least one verb is /find/
  + count how many times they refer to the same entity within the story

* PMI
- P(e(w,d)) => Probability of an event-dep
  + Specifically, verb is /w/ and the dependency is /d/
  + $P(E1) = \frac{Count(E1)}{Count(stories)}$
  + $P(E1,E2) = \frac{Count(E1 & E2)}{Count(stories)}$
- So we are calling /e(w,d)=E1/
- Equation 1:
  $pmi(E1,E2)=log\frac{P(E1,E2)}{P(E1)P(E2)}$
- Equation 2:
  $P(E1, E2)=\frac{C(E1,E2)}{DENOMINATOR}$
  + The denominator is supposed to be the number of all event pairs that share an entity.
  + This is a little more complicated than just the number of stories
